first into the tank tonight is arduino
who wants to make one of life's most
amazing moments a whole lot better my
business is something that i believe
every woman every expecting parent
should have access to
[Music]
thank you sharks so much for having me
my name's edwina sharik
i'm come from regional tamworth an
awesome town in new south wales
and i am the founder of birth beat
i'm a registered midwife mother of two
and now a ceo of a company
and i'm here to ask for two hundred
thousand dollars for ten percent in my
company
so let me tell you a little bit about
why birth feet came about and what it is
we actually do
when i was pregnant with my own daughter
polly i didn't actually do
antenatal classes i believe because i'm
a midwife i'm gonna know what to do
how silly was i it made me realise
had i been more educated i would have
been more empowered in that experience
and my husband wouldn't have been as
scared it was then that i found out that
41
of maternity units have closed in
australia in the last 15 years
we have 300 000 births in australia
a lot of those in rural regional and
remote australia
so i thought that's not good enough so i
created my own classes
so in november last year birthbeat
launched online
it's an online portal that has over 14
hours of
simple to watch videos right from
prenatal yoga
through to what to expect in labor how
do you know when you're in labour what
to pack
through to how to breastfeed your baby
change your nappy
safely swaddle safely sleep since going
online we've experienced
huge success we've got a scalable model
now to get out to all of australia and
potentially the world
thanks very much edwina so you're
looking for uh 200k at a 2 million
valuation 10 i am edwin
so um you're a midwife how many babies
have you delivered oh
hundreds hundreds hundreds i'm not
actually a clinical midwife
now okay i've resigned from my clinical
position to focus 100
on birth beat that's really great i love
people who leave their jobs and focus
100 of their business it's a good thing
isn't it
it is a good thing it's amazing
fantastic that's great so you've got a
real passion for this stuff haven't you
i sure do this is a genuine
product that improves the experience so
what i teach my women is it's about
being educated
understanding the process which removes
the fear and i
see that women actually birth better and
have a more positive experience or a
positive outcome
if they're educated so edwina tell us
how it works how does it work oh yeah
can i show you around the portal
so okay
well this is the epidural exercise that
sounds like
fun so many people don't understand when
they say i'm going to have it in bedroom
the process that's involved let's not
kid ourselves you're not the first one
to put
birthing classes online no
that's right there are some companies
that do it what is unique about
birthday is that i'm actually a
registered midwife it's obstetric
endorsed
so we've had four obstetricians go
through the program plus we offer
through to the breastfeeding consultant
so it's all packaged into this one-stop
shop
what does your husband think about the
idea of you giving up your full-time job
and starting a business
look my husband's a very patient man
thankfully good um
he's an engineer he's the numbers
analytical brain
edwin so did he did he engineer the two
million dollar valuation or do you have
some mathematics behind them no i do
i was gonna say i do have some
mathematics behind that um okay so
the unit is 297 to get entire
modules so 14 hours 14 years
i get 240 profit per unit we've sold 69
units
so we have 19 000
i really see this as you know maybe
lower the price and then subscribe going
forward you know what happens with the
terrible twos what happens with a
one-year-old so you can keep them
on there forever i actually have a plan
so my email system is quite
sophisticated i can know what date of
birth so then i know
four months later that hey we're looking
at starting solid so now's the time to
engage with my customer again
yes and say you need to know what to do
if your baby chokes which leads into a
subscription market yeah
which then yeah which is you know god if
you can get that one right yeah
that's um um what are you mumbling at
what's your plan to take this forward
i'm very excited about some potential
contracts that are coming up we have a
50-unit trial
signed with one of australia's largest
banks to provide this to their employees
in part of their corporate wellness
package that corporate bank
employs 55 000 employees oh very good
we are also deep in discussion with hcf
for birthbeat to be the preferred
provider for their
online platform so is hcf talking about
incorporating it into one of their
programs
yes so and so how big is the hdf
populate the hf they have six thousand
births a year
do you notice someone said anything he
does a lot of talking with me
i'm gonna say something one day just
like he thinks that none of that
other of us can have this conversation
no exactly edwina
naomi have you got something to say yes
hello so
just sorry quickly well i was in the
middle of a question at the same time
are you choked you can have it next okay
no no with respect to hsf catalyst
what did that what the investor what's
your option i can't hear either of you
sorry i'm going to keep talking because
i'm getting tired
i feel like i'm talking to my children
yeah that's right that's a very good
observation
yeah edwina
i know naomi's desperate to talk to you
naomi
sorry i'm patient sometimes
you often demonstrate you're not patient
so that's all right
i'm patient the reason why often we need
to be as investors is because
it doesn't happen in the near term and
it might be a long play
see the thing we don't yet know about
your business
is what it's going to cost to acquire a
customer
to get the growth that you need
so what are you spending on marketing
each
couple receives a book it's posted in
the mail they also get a little bag of
goodie bags and then that's hand posted
to them
do you have a marketing expense above
the line not
yet what i have done is an online
campaign
with that is two videos those two videos
one on instagram one on facebook
one's been viewed 52 000 times one's
been viewed 64 000 times
so still struggling to make the big leap
from from
nineteen thousand dollars to your two
million dollar
valuation yep give me the number
that we think we're going to see in the
next 12 months 2020 i want to be a 5
million
business and i will be
based on that we're going to sign two
corporates
that are both six-figure licenses so
they will buy their licenses
so give me give me a number that you
probably will hit on a revenue line for
the next 12 months
i expect us to be 500 000 in the next 12
months okay
i'm going to tell you where i'm at first
of all
well done i mean you are the authentic
face of
positive birth experiences in australia
i think that's great
i can't say i'm ever going to be a user
of your product
it's not an area where i feel i can add
a huge amount of value
i wish you well but i'm out thank you
very much
so edwina i love what you're doing
especially with the focus on rural and
regional australia
yeah i think you're already evolving
your strategic partnerships in the right
direction
so i don't think you need any of us okay
good luck thanks glenn but i'm out here
thank you
glenn and i are out three of you left
i think you've done an amazing job with
getting a minimum viable product
what i don't see is the fact that you
can scale the infrastructure that you've
got
to justify your valuation so for this
investment i'm out
thank you very much nan
well when you look at investing part of
that we invest in the founders and
you're great and what you've done is
fantastic
entrepreneurs you know i really identify
with them i love what you're doing
especially from regional australia and
for regional australia
i think he's in sounds like
i think i'm confused
so i've never been to a
anything natal class in my life when
you've got the youngest babies
not something i'm dreadfully proud of
but um
hey the babies are healthy i'm still
married it's all good
um so i don't quite get this
uh i i can't see your way towards the
numbers where you're gonna get close to
this
look i think in order just to for us to
leave here sometime they're year
i'm gonna go out okay i can't wait to
wish you all the best
so four sharks are out janine's left
