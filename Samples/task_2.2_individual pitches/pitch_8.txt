next up in the tank is a husband and
wife team who are here to prove their
is ready for a shark to sink their teeth
into
hi sharks my name's elisa and this is my
husband
and business partner elias together we
founded
just jerky an authentic
and all-natural beef jerky
firstly we're here today seeking your
mentorship
we're also here to ask for a 75 000
investment in return for 20 equity share
in our company
beef jerky is a super trendy and loves
snack food
however australians have not yet had the
opportunity
to experience a compelling and authentic
brand
that is a real standout in quality taste
and enjoyment josh jerky is currently
stocked in over 400 stores across
australia
and we're on track to be available in a
thousand outlets by the end of financial
year wow
our aim over the next four years is to
turn that into 5 000 stores
whilst also carving out a unique
position in the global beef jerky market
so sharks are you ready to take a bite
my word absolutely very good well done
so that's 75 000 for 20 so you're
valuing your company at about 3.75
correct okay so can we taste it please
yeah go for it we
also see some packaging yeah sure thing
i'll grab you a few packs which is which
though
there's three different types here so
i'm assuming so the red one
is a chili version that's my favorite
highly recommend it there's an original
which is a garlic
um and pepper flavour right and there's
a herb which we call it herb and it's a
honey and
coriander based flavor
that's hot the chili one yeah it's good
though but it's hot
do you want much chili yeah thank you
oh yeah so how did the idea of making
beef jerky here in australia come around
yeah well it started in canada actually
i was over there on a snowboarding trip
and one of my friends who was living
over there brought holly
beef jerky up the mountain and none of
us had heard of it so we
we tried it and we thought this is the
greatest thing in the world so excited
about it and
on the way back to australia i said to
elise i'm going to start a beef jerky
business and she
she laughed at my face and told me i was
an idiot
yeah so i laughed at him and went yeah
no this
is not it's not going to happen how did
you start to understand how
the beef jerky worked did you get some
cows in the kitchen and did you like i
started in the kitchen
and then built a little factory myself
and had a lisa in there had my mum my
dad my auntie and sister
and then we outgrew that facility pretty
quickly and then outsourced manufacture
and now it's made in brisbane
um awesome it's made in brisbane so if
you've outgrown your kitchen
you could talk about some pretty healthy
numbers then to support your 375
000 evaluation what do you reckon yeah
so we're on track for
260 000 turnover this year
and we believe we'll hit close to 900
the year after why
just through all the new stores we keep
bringing on and the increase in sell
rate through our existing
customers so i'm intrigued because my
family invested in
jerky production about 20 years ago in
north queensland okay
so i know this industry backwards yeah
right
other people running the business they
never got the traction and it all fell
apart
why is just jerky working there's a
there's a big part of timing so
the industry now are people looking for
more whole foods snacks high protein
snacks as well
we made sure that the product was
all natural ingredients making sure that
the sugar's quite low
it was a healthy alternative as well as
delicious
you've asked for 75 000
so what's that going to turn into how
are you planning to return that
so over four year period we believe we
can triple it
that's just focusing on the domestic
market however we know there's a massive
opportunity in the export market
look beef jerky is a big market 2.8
billion i think to be precise to the us
uh but i think it's too early stage for
me i don't have a problem with your
valuation but i'm not going to be your
partner i'm out thank you
thank you andrew this is one of the best
quality joke i've seen
thank you awesome he's in love with your
product which is a good thing
you know i came into shark tank years
ago i wanted to do a few different sorts
of deals
booze and food mostly
so i'm really keen to get in here i'll
give you the 75 i'm not giving you
nothing
i'm going to buy equity from you for 75
000 bucks
for 40 thank you
okay so we've got one shark in 75k for
40
i'm just i'm gonna sit for five minutes
but you do fit in i'm in
organic supermarkets uh i'm into
wellness
uh and food technology so you fit there
but i'm just not sure
you'd love to have a decisive investor
wouldn't you rather than someone who
sits on the fence all the time that'd be
fantastic can you imagine a board
meeting with that
i actually think having mentors around
you who are considered
is a very valuable thing what you don't
want is somebody who rushes in and
rushes
out because you've made it really clear
that you're in this for the long haul
and you do need an investor who's by
your side with has the same
values and that's really important i'm
going to make you an offer
75 000 which is what your request is for
35 in other words i'm trying to undercut
this bugger because i think i'd be a
better partner
thank you naomi okay
you ready yet no not yet okay
i'm happy to make an offer
so i'm actually going to match the red
balloon
i have a name naomi
so glenn's in for thirty five percent
seventy five thirty five cups thank you
so much glenn
and janine where are you at um look i i
quite like your product i'm not a
natural uh consumer of it
see if it was dried carrots or a dried
cucumber should be in yeah no i would be
vegan should be right there
i'll make you an offer i'll give you
seventy five thousand dollars
for thirty seven percent thank you and
obviously
um i've got more experience in the
people on the table with regard to the
food
okay we've got steve in the right corner
seventy-five thousand in the blue corner
forty percent
the decisive one mind you name took them
too long naomi thirty-five 35
for 75 000. glenn is the same 75 000 for
35
and janine has come in at 75 000 for 37
can we take a moment yeah okay thank you
good luck just remember growth guys
i've got this guys what's that no
she was my body language if you want it
you have to come to 35.
sucks to be you three i got this they're
smart
it's me it's me i got it it's me
yeah 50 bucks
perth couple alissa and elias are
seeking
five thousand dollars for a twenty
percent stake in their jerky business
their new take on an old favorite has
glenn naomi janine
and steve fighting it out you'd love to
have a decisive investor wouldn't you
i'm trying to undercut this bugger
because i think i'd be a better partner
it's me it's me i got it 50 bucks
but now they need to decide which shark
will be best
for their business what are you thinking
oh
um i like glenn i think he knows the
industry really well
um what about janine i don't know
i really like knowing miller
um do you have any inclination to want
to work with steve
i do
keeping in mind we were looking for a
partner yeah janine this is not a beast
juice
no i don't think you're right it's
natural product whether it's
cow or something else it's a natural
product what are you feeling
you choose you're the boss
let's decide out there okay
okay well well done you've had offers
from four sharks
40 from steve 37 from janine and 35
from these two glenn and naomi which is
amazing in its own right
so would you guys be willing to go to 33
who are you talking to oh sorry uh glenn
and naomi
and janine thank you so much for your
offers and steve thank you so much but
it's just
outside the ballpark just a little bit
too far so you've said no to steve's 40
no thank you very much and hopefully we
can sell you a lot to jerky
but come on you you came in here and you
basically just said no i don't want you
i mean that is you've got to do that
better in the future right
you you cannot do that to people right
sure because i could have been back in
i could be quite blunt you said no i'm
so sorry
i think that literally he did not intend
to do that
i'm really sorry about that he did not
do he you're a lovely man he's
don't even worry about it very sensitive
young man seriously he is
the most sensitive shark on the show
so steve's out i'm out
janine would you be interested in 33
at all where i was with 37 i actually
thought that was actually quite
reasonable considering where you've put
in
and how early your business is and also
the long journey you've got ahead of you
i'm staying at 37. thank you thank you
naomi the reason why i went to 35 is
because i wanted to give an extra 5
over steve because i thought i'd be a
better partner but actually
his valuation made all the sense in the
world to me
so i'm also not going to adjust from 35
so if your numbers stack up in due
diligence i'll go your 33
who did you really want who do you think
can add the most value to your business
you choose
um thank you so much for your offers i
said we didn't mean to offend
thank you to janine for your offer um
and for all the feedback
really valuable feedback um naomi
also thank you so much i'll go to
thirty-five
making this difficult um i'm thank you
so much janine
all right we'll do a deal at 35.
i think we'll have to go with colleen
at 33 percentage
good decision hello thank you great
great work
thank you so much thanks guys thank you
thank you very much
thank you bye
well done when she said i'll have glenn
it was like
pain i'll have glitters
they didn't really want you glenn well
you hoped they were hungry
yes it was a feeding frenzy over here
absolutely nerve-wracking in a bit of
shock gee steve snapped a bit at you
didn't he i feel that's so bad
i really liked him but he was definitely
glenn he
he was all lean his feet first was yes
yes and he was fighting for us
