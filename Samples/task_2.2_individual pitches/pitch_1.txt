good evening sharks I'm Bill I'm John we
met through the inventors Association in
Melbourne oh wow there's an Adventures
association's Association Melbourne John
has created a double check drill
creative I like it many years ago I was
trying to build a cubby house for my
children I had a ladder and I gained up
I've driven the holes then I'd come down
I'd pick up the next cordless drill then
I'd screw the screws in oh blow this I'm
wasting too much time I go out and buy a
double Chuck drill no such thing
so I built my first prototype in 1990.
so that's 28 years that's been a long
journey I've interviewed many Carpenters
plumbers electricians DIYs and the
response to buying a one-handed double
Chuck drill has been absolutely
electrifying which is what's kept me
going but we've stopped now because we
run out of Dosh well that happens it is
patented in Australia number 2008 314052
and we have a patent in the UK
799 seven uh We believe We believe
you're on the numbers
[Laughter]
we would like you to invest in our
business for ninety thousand dollars to
buy 25 of our business John's been
addict for quite a long time and this is
probably our last chance so we need you
Bill and John thank you so much for
coming today I'm enjoying this picture
already and you barely started so you're
asking for ninety thousand dollars for
25 yes which values your business at 360
300. Andrew Goodman on the figures
so it's a low valuation and the reason
for that is that we are not in
production yet
tell us what is a double Chuck drill
let's show us how it works we're going
to come up here all right let's have a
look come on show us how it works
for me please can I hold some yeah you
can hold some thank you I always thought
you had a screw this
as you can see you drill your pilot hole
and then press the check change that's
amazing so so this rotation is the key
Point yes yeah that's what the patents
on the automatic change
that's a double Checker
and look at it he loves this he loves
his Adventure doesn't he hello anybody
hey John come to us
thank you
that's really really that's pretty cool
yeah it is yeah yeah and it's Unique
there are multi-head drills out there
aren't there I'm sure yes there are how
are they different to yours you've got
to use two hands to change the Chucks so
you basically so this is this is all
about you've got to turn it physically
yes I thought and the work safe people
don't like that because of the chance
that the trigger should could turn it
and reel their hand wow
how much money have you invested in this
job you really want to know that Andrew
I'm afraid so 2.3
2.3 million dollars
oh my god wow where did you get 2.3
million dollars from I had two
properties two Farms so you sold the
properties to pay for this invention
well the bank said I had to owe them too
much money
you've got to remember is that I'm just
a farmer and I'm not really a
businessman and so I made a few mistakes
I'm still flabbergasted over you've put
2.3 million right don't worry yeah
John over the years you know sold the
first
was it ever a moment you went
I'm out no never
but you haven't sold one no not just why
we're here
you own the Peyton John yes and Bill do
you own any shares in this 20 have you
put real dough in as in time and effort
Bill's on board because his expertise in
he's a businessman and I'm not so Bill
how long have you been on the journey
with John
probably close to three years now so in
all that time
did you ever Ponder
this is a dead horse and we're flogging
it too hard
John has invented an ingenious drill
that solves a simple handyman problem
but it's cost him 28 years and 2.3
million dollars without a single sale to
date
Bill how long have you been on the
journey with John
for close to three years now so in all
that time
or think that this is a dead horse and
we're flogging it too hard
I'm a firm believer that the concept is
great
what I've done since I've been involved
with John I said don't spend any more
money excellent let's assess this let's
work out the best way of going about it
that's right and don't put good money
off the bat you didn't want to
invalidate him and his invention but at
the same time you didn't want him to
spend any more money no I got it so who
have you shown it to which of the global
brands in this machine this tools
business have you shown it to we showed
it to TTI in Hong Kong tectonic
Industries and we've showed it to Bosch
Black and Decker what about DeWalt yeah
well all those were some years ago
Andrew yeah so you've got nobody
currently reviewing the technology with
the view to licensing no
we nearly had a sale to seas in America
who've got almost 4 000 stallers getting
a deal with the retailer is not going to
help you because they're going to ask
you to produce stock the license deal is
the only way we can rescue you John
we need to find someone who will take
the design license off you and that's
the way you get a certain amount back
for each drill sold
you left the licenses to a drill
manufacturer yep that'd be the way to go
yeah so uh look John negotiate a good
deal and try and get a larger portion
back of that 2.3 million dollars you
possibly can I
doubt you'll get the whole thing back
I think honestly here you're talking
about recovering some funds
not getting a return on your investment
really cool drill but I'm out
good luck thanks Steve
I think it's a very very clever design
and you've solved a problem that is out
there I'm not a natural partner here for
you so and I don't think I can open the
doors you need me to open so I'm out
thanks for coming on the show I think
you've taught our audience all sorts of
things about entrepreneurship and that
includes persistence because gosh you
guys have absolutely stuck at it
unfortunately for this deal though I'm
out yep okay okay
Glenn
bill
you know I am an impatient handyman and
I absolutely will be a customer love it
it is a really functional practical tool
um I will rack my brains around my
network let's see if we can get a
manufacturer to share your vision it's a
tough gig but unfortunately today guys
I'm out
gentlemen I'd love to help you
but it's an offer of help it's not an
investment
I happen to know the number two guy in
DeWalt in the US which is the trades arm
of back and Decker you get me your
painting papers I'll Endeavor to see if
they all license you and and rescue this
journey of yours which has been
incredible that will be great
appreciated so you know you're not alone
in this journey that's okay it all says
I've got stickability stick ability yeah
all the best but Bill and John Take Care
thank you very much no worries and thank
you for your time oh hang on John's not
letting uh the products he's going to
put a look at that he's so neat I love
it
