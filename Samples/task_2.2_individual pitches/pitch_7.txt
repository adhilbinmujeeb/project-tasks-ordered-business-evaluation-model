my business is the fourth business that
i've started
some of the other ones weren't as
successful as this but
i know that my business now is going to
make the sharks go crazy
that's pretty zen
doing yoga meditating
you're gonna need to be relaxed when we
get into him
leave him alone steve he's so nasty
[Laughter]
okay when are you ready
hi janine naomi steve andrew and glenn
my name is jake and i'm the founder of
coconut bowls
today i'm asking you for three hundred
thousand dollars
in exchange for ten percent of my
every year billions of coconut shells
are discarded
and burned as waste we reclaim these
shells and turn them into these
beautiful bowls
that people love eating from
every single day hundreds of our
customers are sharing photos of them
using our bowls on social media
and this amount of user generated
content and exposure
has allowed us to grow without focusing
on paid marketing
after selling our first coconut bowl in
january 2016
we've now sold well over 100 000 units
nice while our main focus has been
selling online
our products are used and sold in
hundreds of cafes
and retail stores around the world wow
in our first year of trading
we turned over two hundred thousand
dollars okay good job
last year we grew by more than five
hundred percent
to a revenue of almost 1.2 million whoa
and this year our organic growth
is forecasted
to push beyond three million dollars
holy jesus lord
i believe that there's never been a
better time to be a prophet
with purpose business that's us and with
your help
we can make sustainability sexy wow
thank you go jake well
congratulations great pitch just to
summarize jake you're looking for 300
000
for 10 so you're valuing your business
at 3 million yes correct it's not a bad
valuation for a brand new business but
your sales are impressive so it seems to
me you've almost started a community in
the coconut bowls happens to simply be
the product
around that community is that how you
see it
that's exactly right i started obviously
the coconut bowls
instagram page i then created an
instagram page called vegan bowls
and smoothie bowls because that's what
people were creating in our product
our coconut bulb branded account has
over 200 000 followers
we're on facebook we're also on youtube
pinterest and twitter and we are coconut
bowls on all of those
platforms let me show you yeah what
people
basically do with these coconut bowls
yeah they're like
is that a candle that's a candle it
feels very barley doesn't it
it is well we actually began in bali i
came across a
similar product but it was being sold as
like a souvenir to tourists
yep i thought it was actually just
better as a raw
shell so i had a guy make them for me
took them over my suitcase and began
selling them
so they're not manufacturing barley now
though are they no so we actually
reclaim them from
coconut farms in vietnam we pay them to
basically sort them by the size and the
quality that we need
and then we take them to our workshop
where i employ
local crafts people to turn them into
the bowls
you know jake how you doing good steve
how are you good thanks hey um what does
it cost you to produce one of these
bowls
a couple of dollars what do you sell one
for mate we sell them for
12.95 retail okay right
if you're a really good entrepreneur
you've already looked at the next 12
months
what's the real profit for the next 12
months after paying yourself a salary
i believe six hundred thousand dollars
truly and what are you paying yourself
eighty thousand dollars okay
and you've got how many team members
i've been mindful and i've hired mainly
contractors that's basically why i'm
pitching for the money i think that it's
time to build a team around me of people
who believe
in my product and my vision excellent
jake i have to be honest you went from a
joke to someone something serious
because when i sat here i went coconut
bowls really
but wow super impressive for such a
short period of time so congratulations
so with that in mind i'd like to offer
three hundred thousand dollars for 28
poor kicks it off
you the only shareholder yes i own 100
of the business
i'll give you 300 000 for 25 percent
it's the community i'm interested in in
you i think you're really on to
something
i'll throw an offer at you based on the
fact that i do know this space
i've spent three years reinvented myself
so i
can support people like you and you have
my 100
focus as a an investor and a supporter
and a mentor
because i don't have a day job anymore
but he he also spends a lot of time on a
fishing boat and every time i'm calling
he's like can't hear you
can't hear you and jake he hasn't he
hasn't built a website that got to a
valuation of six billion
didn't i just say i was about to give
you an offer and wasn't i rudely
interrupted by a couple of parrots down
the hill
can we give the mark back to glenn
please thank you very much jake i like
it i like your style oh jake you're good
he's good
he's good so let's give you the offer so
these parents can work out whether they
want to get a little bit more serious
300 000 for 20 of your business
janine's offered you 28 percent i've
offered you 25
glenn's offered 20 naomi what are you
gonna do
i'll offer you 300 000 for 18 percent
it's a nice offer thank you navy
steve what are you gonna do
i'm out
i'm not in this i don't give a toss
about vegan stuff but that's a word of
advice
you've got to make them fight it out for
less than 10 percent
because you've got a great business mate
if you're confident on 600 grand you're
going to go out at a five times multiple
you're going to stitch them up for more
because you're selling equity here right
it's pretty valuable because you've got
growth
people who are out they they have no
voice because they're out
mate if you take if you take more than
10 you're doing yourself a disservice
you can't hear them stitch these guys up
for a single digit
when they're out they're out you've done
so much better than any of these in the
same growth rate steve you're not
helping him
you're not helping him make a decision
here
if he thinks it's so incredible he's not
cracking a check
i don't do vegan i don't do vegan
now he is the classic guy that says
i don't care if it's a widget if it's a
good business i'll get it so if he
thinks it's so bloody good
he hasn't made you an offer i haven't
tried to rip you off yet either and you
haven't made an offer
well then shut up
so you have to ignore anyone who's not
prepared to put their money where their
mouth is
money talks right i'll revise my offer
to 20
300 000 for 20 ah
i'll match naomi's offer
18 i i would be absolutely thrilled to
have all four of you as part of my
no you wouldn't yeah not gonna happen
if you're not gonna happen it's easy
jake categorically sorry i'm not going
to work with them
okay if you accept her evaluation
i'll go halves with her yes
andrew do you think that this is the
kind of product that you could push into
the
states i i love the whole community
space
it's scalable it's online and i'm
absolutely convinced that myself and
janine
can help you grow that so they're
teaming up
that's pretty sad so if you really want
a good team
that knows how to play i'm prepared to
go with naomi who is
an absolute legend on working with lists
of community and making sure you're
maximizing your opportunities in those
communities
i think he said two and a half seconds
ago that you wouldn't do a deal with
anyone so you're just a flip-flop right
i'm an opportunist
jake is centering his thoughts after
receiving
multiple offers for his million-dollar
coconut bowl business
so what's your decision
naomi and glenn have teamed up so have
janine and
andrew now they just have to wait
all right i'm gonna do a deal
who with
janae and andrew
i am so pleased i'm very excited about
what you're doing well done
thank you we three are gonna kill it hey
i like it food online it's gonna be good
it's gonna be good
believe it hey high five
hey i like it making money changing the
world
coconut balls eh who thought you'd do a
deal
and who thought we'd fight over it to be
honest my gut was telling me janine just
because of what she's been able to
achieve
with bruce juice and andrew with the
proven success
in america it was just too much for me
to uh
to say no to let's change the world and
make money i like it
yes
