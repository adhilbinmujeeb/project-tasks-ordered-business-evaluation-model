hi sharks I'm Jenny my company is
strange grains gluten-free bakery and
first in Western Australia it's a
wholesale Artisan Bakery I'm looking for
investment of 350 000 for 10 of my
business
it's worth it
okay business came about because I'm a
Celiac and when I first started playing
with this there wasn't much out there in
palatable Breads and a bit of research
and a lot of experiment I came up with a
recipe that I thought was not too bad I
could eat it and I started a market
stall on the strength of it
and after about six weeks I thought hang
on I'm not going to be able to be in my
kitchen for much longer with this and
started looking for a big Bakery it just
took off I had to get Distributors
because I could no longer do the
deliveries myself
once the Distributors came on board it
just went mad and I still can't cope
with Western Australia
so Jenny that's 350 000 for 10 of your
company so you're valuing your company
at 3.5 million dollars yes
can you point to your best selling loaf
of bread this is the best seller to make
a large loaf costs a dollar sixty what's
its price point between 13 and 15.
hey 13 and 15. yeah so it's a premium
product and you make it for 1.60 can I
can I look at a 13 loaf of bread some of
the top restaurants in Perth use that
across the board because it's a really
nice look how big that is there's
probably two loaves that's 13 bucks
Buck 60s worth of ingredients yeah
this is fabulous thank you would you
like to sit down I'd love to thank you
it's fantastic I can't stop eating it
you've done a great job here so I'm not
surprised you've got all these Awards
so what is the secret
no I don't really want to tell you on
air so it literally is a secret it is a
secret recipe okay that is that's
amazing
um three and a half million Buck
valuation can you talk to your economics
and of the business please let us
understand how you've come to that
turnover last Financial year was just
under a million wow this financial year
is going to be double that
two million turnover I think it might be
even more
do you have much debt or no debt at all
no we paid for it all out of out of
turnover so somebody else well how about
you invested in the business please I
sold eighty thousand dollars worth of
shares every now and again you know I
get a bit short or something because
I've never even had a credit card and
then I'll use some of my own money and
then all no dirt clap me I bought a
credit card this year but I haven't used
it yet yeah this year for the first but
she hasn't used it yet which is good
it's very great
now look I'm going to let you know where
I'm at
well I think you you have a great
business it's doing exceptionally well
I just can't get excited it's health
food I can care less about it
I'm going to bow out and um really wish
you all the best Jenny it's been
fantastic
but an Iron Man
Jenny
um I love what you've done this is going
to develop into a beautiful brand around
artisan bread concept
the thing that I'm getting nervous about
is from a marketing position
two niche
you can't justify the valuation
okay thanks anyway
Jenny how old were you when you started
the business
six years
are you married
uh I've got a few exes
a few X's I like that breaking hearts
are crossing across the West
they probably can't keep up with you so
Jenny I love the fact that you've done
this late in life because I'm sort of
you know fond of this sort of Twilight
years and I'm a great believer that you
keep on learning and growing
irrespective of how old you are and I
think you're a fantastic example of that
we're all in all of you that's very
obvious but I'm not really the person
who add a lot of value to your business
in terms of scaling it
so I'm out
thanks anyway so what would you like
from us to help you with
um
I guess I'm just looking for a partner
too I can lean on a little bit sometimes
you know I hate making all the decisions
myself that's I guess that's what I want
is the advice I have no idea what's the
right way I mean Jenny you're wrong I
was going to say absolutely wrong 80 000
bucks no debt and you built this
business you've got more business acne
than you know you actually have you know
what businesses business is common sense
and making sure you make more income
than there is expenses that's as simple
as it gets and then how do you grow it
so I think you can do it without me
I'm out okay thanks anyway thank you
so four sharks are out just one shark
left
chain
there's people in every corner of
Australia who can't eat gluten I know
would you like to be in the coals and
woolies of the world in other words that
it becomes our normal would you like
that I would love to have it all over
Australia yeah but I physically am not
able to cope with it
and I mean I figured I could do it
myself anyway but it might take 10 years
and hey I'm in my 80s then so I'd really
love to see it up and running honestly
going to warwicks and Coles that's gonna
be hard labor
I think the coals and woolies strategy
is wrong it goes into the big
Supermarket chains it dilutes the brand
and damages the brand immediately so
Jenny maybe maybe the right partner fit
for you isn't sitting right here right
now
do you like swimming in the tank it's
fun isn't it
69 year old Jenny wants 350 000 for a 10
share of her healthy bread business four
of the sharks are out leaving only one
name are you in
chair
woolies of the world I would love to
have it all over Australia yeah honestly
going to Wars and cold that's gonna be
hard labor
and damages the brand of integrity
so I am going to make you an offer
but it's not what you've asked for okay
and it's because you do need a business
partner and that is going to require
such energy and resource it does come
with some conditions
because if I do this
I don't want to limit the opportunity by
keeping it as an artisan product meaning
the recipe stays the same but I would
like to see it in every supermarket in
Australia so that they have choice
so my offer is
is 350 000 which is what you've asked
for
but for 25 of your business
what I didn't want to buy was a lot more
work that's that's the only worry at the
moment without making too many comments
on your range obviously as you've
identified you're getting you want to do
less work not more and that's fair
enough so you need to be
assure the nomia is okay with that
so Jenny maybe maybe the right partner
fit for you isn't sitting right here
right now
Jenny I don't think they're confusing
you the only decision you have to make
is do you want to go alone or do you
want a partner and you've got one offer
you're going I've got a couple of my
sister and nephew out there I'd love to
go and just run it past them absolutely
go for it
foreign
the offer is good in that it would get
me everywhere in Australia
but it would take an awful lot of work
Hunter you were saying you thought 20
shouldn't be more than 20 but they're
off asking for 25 percent
I'm just afraid I'm buying myself a
whole lot more work
my job is actually to make her see a
bigger opportunity whatever that looks
like
thank you for having us all
it's a great honor so you've been out
there considering Naomi's offer you've
wanted 350 000 for 10 of your business
valuing it at three and a half million
Naomi's offered you 350 000 for 25 of
your business valuing it at 1.4 million
what have you come up with
if we went in together
would you consider 20 percent
when it comes to the percentage I looked
really carefully at why 25
and the value that I'd bring to the
business and I'm not prepared to devalue
my time or my energy
yeah okay
[Applause]
wonderful
you won't be alone see you Jenny well
done thank you well done you're on your
way
wow congratulations I know
wow
I did isn't that lovely I haven't had
time to absorb it yet probably middle of
the night I'll wake up going hey but
right now it's just oh yeah deal you're
like the grandmother that everybody
wants I wish I was 20 years younger it
would have been so much easier
I think you've still got that fire in
your belly though you've got that magic
about you that will make this go far
thank you so much you're so sweet
