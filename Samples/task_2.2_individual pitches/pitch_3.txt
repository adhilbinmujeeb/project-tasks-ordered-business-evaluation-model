my name is Laurence bardenhorst and I
currently reside in wanaru in Perth
I have a product here
which is going to revolutionize the
fishing industry
as it is that simple and that smart
I am looking
for fifty six thousand dollar stake
for nine percent equity
welcome to fish Frenzy this product will
be very sought after as in the world at
the moment there are between eight and
twelve percent of women fishermen
fisherwoman
who are very competitive and are always
seeking The Edge I'm going to have to
explain it so we have converted wave
energy to perform useful mechanical work
in the water it's the first of its type
in the world and it has achieved Beyond
expectation so your goldfish at home in
the tank with it moving its tail like
that compressors and decompresses the
water sending out signals hey I'm lost
Lauren just to confirm you want 56 000
for nine percent so you value your
company six hundred and twenty two
thousand do you think you could show us
right now yeah yeah then we'll
understand what you're pitching okay I
have no idea what he's talking about I
need a bit of show and tell that's all
what is going on here is this only for
female Fisher people or male no no this
is for for both we have a product in
there you see how the Piston moves up
and down yeah that does that 360 times
in an hour because of the wave you mean
because the wave the waves you're just
hanging in the trough of the wave so you
hang it on your boat hang off the boat
right hang it off the boat
and what has it got to do with women
well they're 12 percent of women
fishermen who are always looking for the
edge this but now why why is that got to
do with women though they like they're
always looking for the edge this is an
edge which nobody else has if it doesn't
men want the edge no we're lazy we hate
to be oh no no the men know everything
about fishing oh careful I think there's
some women out there that will it's a
well-known scientific fact that men are
better fishermen than Fisher than women
so right now you're being the wave right
I'm so confused what is your
job and I still don't know what the
product is my product is this that is in
the water what does it do like let's
start early I was getting there oh wow
just for those of us who are not
fishermen Burley is it is a bait that
you put in the water to attract fish to
to catch fish you've got to create a
Fish Feeding Frenzy good okay you know
I've got a Burly bucket at home it's
basically a bucket with some holes in it
you tight the side of your boat you toss
it over what the boat does is it rocks
up and down and it agitates the Burley
yes and the Builder comes out you should
go on Shark Tank I should go on Shark
Tank
have you sold any of these
no I haven't I've still got to purchase
the molds we've only finished with the r
d stage now those are models how many of
these things do you think you could sell
because you're asking us to invest in a
business worth 622 000 as a business a
first-time product probably a hundred
thousand a year
you think there's a hundred thousand
fishermen out there who are going to
need this now Fisher women with an age
person thing expert
um and a male and a male
what I'm hearing is this is a bit of a
gimmick to get fish to come in the
vicinity of where you're fishing to
improve your chances that's what
everybody does to cause a fish that's
what your product does basically it's a
bit of it's a bait right yes uh well you
didn't get me on the hook I'm afraid but
I wish you well I'm out
this product is not a product that I
actually would buy myself
um you gave us the most confusing pitch
I've seen in three years in Shark Tank
so Lawrence as soon as I heard fish a
woman
I didn't understand I didn't think
fishing was gender specific and you lost
me burn out
you've got a really Innovative mind but
as a guy who's pitching don't get lost
in the first minute of your pitch
or Steve Lawrence I'm out of thank you
thank you very much
okay Lauren look after yourself keep
going
thanks have a good day I actually agree
with Steve I would say that is the worst
pitch I can remember we didn't know what
his product was we didn't know what he
dropping him
