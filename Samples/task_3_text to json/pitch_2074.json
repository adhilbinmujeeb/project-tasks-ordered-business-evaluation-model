We were losing between $900,000 and $1.5 million for three years in a row. Right. It is expensive, baby. Sure. So that was a big, big, big burn, and it was scaring the living you know what out of me... ...until we sold it to Albertsons for $340 million. So I'm a believer in this space. And I like the product. So I'm thinking you're gonna need to raise somewhere between another 5 and 10 million bucks. That's exactly what we're doing right now, yep. Okay, and so that's extremely dilutive. I'm gonna make you the same offer I made the Plated guys. They choked on it, but we all made a lot of money later. I will do the $500,000 as debt at 9.5%, and I'll take the 7% as equity... It's the same. ...so that you're not going to dilute yourself any more, and that 7%'s gonna get diluted down to about 4% by the time you finish. And I'll help you with the A round. A lot more than that. I know how to do that syndication. I love the deal, so I'm definitely considering it. It's not off the table.",
