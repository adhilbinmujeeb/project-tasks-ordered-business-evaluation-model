hi i'm anne-marie and this is alicia
and together we've formed
weddingrunner.com wearingmonrock.com
will specialize in designing
manufacturing and distribution
of a customized rug that will run the
length of any churchill or wedding venue
the runner is designed and ordered
online in a simple five-step process
now couples everywhere especially brides
spend a huge amount of time
money and energy trying to make the
biggest day of their lives that extra
bit special
we believe we have designed the product
to give them that something special
turning weddings from ordinary to
extraordinary giving them that wow
factor
now we realize that we're starting up
this business in recession but we've
used this to our advantage
we have secured manufacturing deals in
china distribution leads throughout
ireland and the uk
and pakistan deals the recession has
allowed us to negotiate prices and
credit terms
that two years ago we simply couldn't
get now there is no comparable product
but as this product will not hold a
patent it is about being first to market
and prompt development
we need your expertise to market this
globally as quickly as possible
we are looking for 45 000 euro for 10
equity thanks for your time and we
welcome any questions
hi i'm marie hi alicia i'm sean hi sean
tell me a little bit about you're saying
that this is ordered online
and it's sort of unique to the
individual person is it has their
their name or whatever run absolutely on
the website you'll have a choice of 20
different templates
and 20 colors which would in total give
you i think it's about 400
templates so it's a simple five-step
process where you go in
you pick your design you pick your color
you add your text
you decide in your lens and then payment
hi girls
hi bobby is my name hi bobby um is there
anybody else doing this
there's no comparable product at the
moment no there isn't only half a
comparable one
well there's one company in america who
do it on its cotton
and it retails at twelve hundred dollars
based on a sixty foot
what's your cost on that it's 60 foot
runner it will retail at 999
and that will cost us 365. delivery
is that pro rather than if we get
smaller it is costed per square foot
per square meter so absolutely yeah
thank you
i'm marie and alicia you don't know me
and i don't know you but i do know of
you
because you're a very successful rug
designer from dundalk
yes yes aren't you you're the yeah
you're the viscosky joyce
i mean i'm not saying that no no but i'm
not saying enough
no no but i just want to know and tell
us about your route to market i presume
you're going to wedding fairs you're
going to try and promote it how's that
going to be achieved and
when do you see sales actually being
made we're doing fairs for the next
three months between ireland and uk we
actually think we'll be taking sales at
these wedding fairs
it's all going to be about linking up
with people in the business because
people aren't going to be able to find
us
googling because they don't know about
it yet
i like the concept i particularly like
the online side of it
it's not an area that i could add huge
value to in terms of
either weddings like like nile or or or
that so
i'm going to say i think to be a good
success but i'm going to declare myself
out
okay thank you okay thanks
i'm not
going to invest
okay tell you why because i think you're
so smart
you don't need my help just before you
declare
yourself yeah enormous okay you have a
dark home business
and you're probably one of the major
success stories in ireland thank you and
if
between yourself and between us it could
be huge
it really could be huge everything is a
partnership and it's all about selling
it's all about experience it's all about
the context sure if you put the whole
lot together
what could we achieve the difference is
the difference is
i sold something on the internet that
people
needed they were hotel rooms from the
cheapest
to the most expensive this is something
much more specialized
it's stunning it's fabulous but it's if
you like it's probably not
the right time for me ladies i'm afraid
i'm out
okay well i like this business i like
what you're doing
and i think you've got the drive and the
skills
to bring it to market um i would be
interested
in putting up half the money okay okay
um and that's assuming my friend here on
my left
uh may have an interest in coming in
with me okay
um and for that i would want 20 percent
of the business
okay thank you for your offer ladies
just whilst uh nyle is uh pondering that
i'm going to uh wish you luck with the
business and declare myself out
it's good it's good and it'll work
that's a great response thank you thank
you but i would question at a thousand
euro
it's just you know it's a lot of money
for couples now to you know
it's more than what the average bride is
paying for her dress
do not believe this idea people paint
thousands there's a very tiny
high-end luxury market of well-off
girls that go off to london to buy their
dresses at thousands the majority
are paying in the hundreds we talked to
a lot of brides who said they were
spending 450 or on an art and they were
maybe putting three artists in the
church and yet they walk into the church
and it's
great and gloomy and the flowers are up
there at the top of the aisle
and they wanted something different and
something bespoke certainly you know i
have enough exposure to the
to the wedding business in terms of
investment i'm not really interested in
owning part of this business so i'm out
so
unfortunately girls
my half isn't good enough just don't
knock yourself out completely yet we can
take so much to this business like we
we really want your investment like you
are the god in branding
once we get a few of these out in the
market it's everyone's going to be
talking about them if this
really really could be huge it could be
the next hotel.com or bigger
this is why all bridesmaids are lovely
and if we were to say maybe we'd go to
twenty percent i already said it yeah
yeah
okay right okay it was a nice try emery
you're not helping me there
we're looking in the ghost yet but we
really we won't expose you
and i know and you know that when we are
exhausted after all these fears you'll
be there with a cup of coffee
and that's how big a brand insomnia is
i'm flattered by i'm flattered by your
adulation girls
