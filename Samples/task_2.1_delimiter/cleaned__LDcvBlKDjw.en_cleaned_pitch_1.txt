hello dragons my name is andy marcus i'm
president and ceo of mra beauty
solutions
we're an ottawa-based cosmetic company
and i'm here to ask for two hundred
thousand dollars for ten
percent of my company two million dollar
valuation that's what you think your
business is worth
hang on you better have some sales honey
oh i have sales darling
what i have is called the six in one
beauty solution it's a
multi-functioning mineral based powder
it takes the place of a foundation a
concealer a blush
a bronzer it can also be used as a
lipstick and an eyeshadow the biggest
differentiating factor between our
product and other mineral based products
on the market is that it's one
multi-functioning shade for everybody
so it actually works on um women of
color
caucasians asians east asians i've got
to see it yeah mr a mineral makeup comes
in
only one color but andy claims its heat
activated formula
self-adjusts to your skin's ideal shade
i actually want to come and see it
before and after so
i want to see what this looks like i can
see you from there but i want to see
close up okay so i've got ashton done so
you see she looks airbrushed yeah
totally illuminated yeah
i'm going to do half and natasha's face
so you see how it's going on
a little more pink on her it looks as
though arlene doesn't look any different
it looks a lot different that's actually
fairly amazing
it's like you look a lot different
this is like all the mints in one this
is all you need to be made up that's all
you need
andy's been selling mistura for almost a
year and sales so far
are in the 150 000 range not bad for a
brand only selling in catalogs and
websites
andy what's unique about this product
did you invent it i actually went on a
plane and went to all sorts of
laboratories across the us and canada to
try and get this done
is there anything proprietary about it
though you can't patent
a makeup product because if you deviate
even like an eighth of a teaspoon it
becomes a completely different formula
why is this worth two million dollars
i'll tell you why a large percentage of
it is potential based
so i have to pay for potential no
you build your business to a point where
you need help right so if i had enough
working capital to hire account managers
or people who could open up channels of
distribution
why is it worth two million tell me all
the reasons why you need money but he's
asking me where that two million is
coming from
well i'm getting to that because if
it'll come from being able to afford
sales reps
but why is it worth two million dollars
today
i obviously haven't articulated to you
what channels to trade we have in place
already what kind of vendor agreements
we have in place already
but you're asking for 200 today and
you're willing to give up the equity
why don't you really just need a loan
i have entertained the thought of a high
interest loan for
a predetermined valuation that's what
i'm getting to
you really need a loan silence robert
i'm gonna make an offer
i'll loan you two hundred thousand
dollars at 21
annual interest okay i want a warrant
for 80
of your equity i'll call it anytime i
want you want 80
are you out of your mind you're dealing
with the economic realities of today on
a startup you're not going to get a
better deal i'm also dealing with a
recession-proof
industry i'm agent offer yes or no
now you know right now you should just
tell them to pound sand that's a stupid
am i allowed
yeah sounds like a no to kevin's offer
but the other dragons aren't ready to
take a powder on this product if we go
this way i give you the 200 000
for 50 of your company
what you do really well is you're a good
salesperson you've got into all these
tracks
but somebody has to pull it all together
you're not the person to do that
we have to go and hire somebody to do
that which costs money
you know what you are i gotta i gotta
say no i'm not finished yet you're
leaving but you're never finished
you're not making an offer you're not
making an offer i'm about to make one
and you guys can just listen to me for a
minute because i've listened to you for
about the past
half hour
what i would propose is 200 000 for
35 of the company
but i would want you running the company
and i wouldn't do it
unless you were running the company i
think you were absolutely a stellar ceo
and i think you've got a real vision for
the product
i'd have to go into the back and talk
with my advisors
you have actually jim's made you a very
similar jim did not find a happy medium
between 50 and 10. i think he was asking
you to find a happy medium
i would go as high as 20 percent
i'm worried about how i get a decision
made on the company
do you want to just do the deal with me
35
35 yeah i'd have to be a minimum of 35.
okay um i'm just going to go back and
think about it
the offer 200 000 from a last minute
alliance between jim and arlene
but they want 35 25 more than andy came
willing to part with
okay so jim and arlene are together now
i think there's only one offer yeah okay
35 for 200 000 is extremely rich i think
our youtubers
really really really increase sales
that's the thing she's the smart money
it's like wearing makeup without wearing
makeup like a glow but it's all one
i think i would do 25 with those two
that's where i'm at okay
i can't give up more than 25
i would be literally selling myself
shorter than short if i were to go
higher than that i would be devaluing
what i've put in and what i've built
andy just to confuse you a little bit
i'll do that deal if they don't
a surprise bid from brett suddenly puts
jim and arlene's offer
in jeopardy
so are you clear on the offers marketers
business friendly bread
oil and gas brett
yeah okay it's a deal good all right
well done pleasure we got a little
homework to do yeah good
cool thank you congratulations
congratulations good stuff
and you're leaving me with a heavy heart
you still could have owned 20
andy
kevin you're gonna be in my dreams
tonight and only because i i'm gonna
feel bad for you that you lost out
and that we won't be having champagne on
my yacht
you
